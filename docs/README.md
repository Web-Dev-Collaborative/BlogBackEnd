# Blog Back End Project

## My Role

This was a solo project.

## Project Description

This is a potential back end for a blog contributed to by many authors with tagging functionality and a couple of endpoints sorting posts by popularity.

## Tech Stack

- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node):  a JavaScript runtime.
- [Knex](https://github.com/knex/knex):  a query builder for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite3, designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.
- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express):  a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.
- [bcrypt](https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt/):  modern(-ish) password hashing for your software and your servers.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/):   Postman helps you be more efficient while working with APIs.  Using Postman, you can construct complex HTTP requests quickly, organize them in collections and share them with your co-workers.
- [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres):  Open Source Relational Database

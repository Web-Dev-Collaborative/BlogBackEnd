# Hatchways Back-End Assessment Preparation

## Project Description

This is Erica Ingram's submission for the back-end assessment from Hatchways.  The app is deployed at [this link](https://hatchways-betest.herokuapp.com/api).

## Features Done

- [X] new github repo
- [X] add dependencies
- [X] get to app starting point before hitting start
- [X] research/review old apps/samples
- [ ] add appropriate comments
- [ ] make sure there are no console red/yellow errors
- [ ] make sure app organized, no repeated code, all code formatted
- [ ] fill out readme template
- [ ] Cypress testing
- [ ] Postman testing & documentation
- [ ] deploy
- [ ] submit

## Tech Stack

- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node):  a JavaScript runtime.
- [Knex](https://github.com/knex/knex):  a query builder for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite3, designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.
- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express):  a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.
- [bcrypt](https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt/):  modern(-ish) password hashing for your software and your servers.
- [cypress](https://www.cypress.io):  Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.
- Postman (for testing and documentation)

### Breakdown

- Creating a simple JSON API
- Fetching data from an API

## Rubric Requirements

### Correctness

- Passes all of our tests
- Shows great attention to detail
- Goes above and beyond the requirements, such as handling validation of improper inputs, or completing bonus requirements and stretch goals (like deploying an application).

### Code Organization, Readability & Maintainability

- Code utilizes a consistent design pattern.
- Code is well organized and would be easy to extend.
- Design made with consideration to potential future features.
- Code is easy to read - proper indentation, vertical spacing, named constants (no magic numbers), big picture comments, and meaningful variable names.
- You can investigate using a linter to help make your code properly formatted.
- There are small amounts of repeated code, and is well factored into functions.
- Related items are grouped into classes (or something equivalent like structs or objects).

### Code Performance - Efficiency, Data Structures, and Algorithms

- Code that is performant (has a good time and space complexity for the problem given).
- Avoids unnecessary nested for loops and uses the appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- Efficient code that reduces unnecessary code.
- Implements additional features to improve code performance such as (but not limited to) caching, parallel API requests, reducing re-rendering on the front-end, memoization, and other code performance techniques.

### Best Practices & Proficiency in Language/Framework

- Utilizes great programming practices such proper unit testing, reduced warnings, and defensive coding strategies (validation, asserts).
- Demonstrate a good grasp of the language and/or framework. Avoids major anti-patterns in the project (using let vs. const in Javascript, modifying the DOM in React, etc.)
- Utilizes the most advanced features in the framework (for example using functional components, Hooks in React).

### Completion Speed

- A fast completion time. This category is the least important category, so prioritize it the least. We will consider speed with respect to the complexity of your solution. You will receive a low mark in completion if you completed the application slowly and your solution is not complex.

## About the Assessment

The goal of this assessment is to test your frontend development skills. The objective is to replicate a frontend application as close to as possible. You are allowed to use any frontend framework (React.js, Angular, Vue.js, etc.) or just plain old Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Your assessment will be graded based on this rubric.

Your submission takes into consideration how long it takes you to complete it. You are welcome to submit it at any point, however completing it in less than 12 hours increases your chances of being considered for our next interview cycle.

There are five parts to the assessment.  To complete the later parts of the assessment, it will be very beneficial to use a modern frontend framework.

## Available Scripts

### `npm server`

### `npm start`

## Documentation

- This app has been documented via Postman.
- Postman Docs were last published on 08/18/2020
- Postman docs contain examples of all get, post, and put endpoint body submissions AND responses.
